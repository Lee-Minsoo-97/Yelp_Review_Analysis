# Chipotle vs. Taco Bell Yelp Review Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that compares Yelp reviews for two popular Mexican food chains: **Chipotle** and **Taco Bell**. The project leverages natural language processing and statistical analysis to uncover key factors influencing consumer choices, identify sentiment trends, and compare customer experiences across these brands.

## Overview

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- **Compare Customer Sentiment:**  
  Analyze review ratings, review lengths, and overall sentiment to understand how customers perceive each brand.

- **Identify Key Themes:**  
  Use techniques such as topic modeling and token frequency analysis to highlight common topics and trends in the reviews.

- **Evaluate Data Suitability:**  
  Assess the review and customer datasets (extracted from Yelp’s open dataset) to ensure they are robust for answering business questions, such as customer loyalty, satisfaction, and brand positioning.

As noted in the project report, a key focus is determining whether consumers favor Chipotle for its healthier and fresher image, compared to Taco Bell’s emphasis on affordability and indulgence ProjectEDA_Team212.html](file-service://file-UbPhMUBjfvj9Ug5ZNdSkrL).
